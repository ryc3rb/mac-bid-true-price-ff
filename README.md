## Overview

The "Mac.bid True Price Calculator" is a Google Chrome extension designed to help users quickly see an estimated "true price" for items on Mac.bid auction pages. It automatically calculates and displays an estimated final cost by factoring in:

*   The current bid price
*   A buyer's premium (configurable)
*   A lot fee (configurable)
*   Sales tax (configurable)

This helps users make more informed bidding decisions by providing a clearer picture of the potential total out-of-pocket expense if they win an auction.

## Features

*   **Automatic Price Calculation:** Scrapes the current bid from Mac.bid auction pages.
*   **Configurable Fees:**
    *   Set your local Sales Tax Rate (%).
    *   Adjust the Buyer's Premium Rate (%).
    *   Set the per-item Lot Fee ($).
*   **On-Page Display:** Shows a breakdown of the estimated costs directly on the auction page.
    *   **Toggle Visibility:** Show or hide the on-page price overlay.
    *   **Configurable Position:** Choose where the on-page overlay appears (e.g., bottom-right, top-left).
*   **Popup Interface:**
    *   View estimated price details.
    *   Access and modify all configurable settings.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** Attempts to update the price as bids change on the page (using a MutationObserver).
*   **SPA Navigation Support:** Designed to work with Mac.bid's dynamic page loading for different items.

## Known Limitations & Considerations

*   **Website Structure Dependent:** The extension relies on specific HTML structures (CSS selectors) of the Mac.bid website to find the current bid price. If Mac.bid changes its website design, the extension may stop working correctly or entirely until the selectors in `content.js` are updated.
*   **Dynamic Content:** While the extension uses a `MutationObserver` to detect bid changes, highly dynamic sites can sometimes present challenges. The display should update, but there might be slight delays.
*   **Sales Tax Calculation:** Sales tax is calculated on the subtotal (Bid + Premium + Lot Fee). This may not reflect the exact tax calculation method for all jurisdictions or item types.
*   **Shipping Costs:** This extension **does not** factor in shipping costs, which can be a significant additional expense.
*   **Performance:** The extension tries to be performant, but observing DOM changes can have an impact on complex pages. If you notice issues, ensure the on-page overlay is only enabled when needed or report the issue.
